Customer Support Triage Demo
This project demonstrates using multiple GenAI agents to automate the triage of customer support tickets. The system is built with a CLI that deploys, manages, and exposes each agent as an independent API endpoint.

🧩 Project Overview
Goal:
Automatically summarize, analyze sentiment, and route support tickets to the appropriate queue using GenAI agents hosted as microservices/APIs.

Frontend:
A simple dashboard that allows you to upload/view tickets, shows pipeline stages for each ticket, the output at each agent stage, and route/escalation status.

Backend Agents:

/summarize: Ticket Summarizer Agent
Summarizes raw customer messages for conciseness and clarity.

/sentiment: Sentiment Analyzer Agent
Detects urgency, anger, or negative sentiment in tickets.

/route: Priority Router Agent
Decides whether a ticket needs escalation to human support based on summary and sentiment.

🖼️ System Architecture
text
User Uploads Ticket (Raw Text) ➔
  [API /summarize] ➔ Summarized Issue ➔
  [API /sentiment] ➔ Sentiment Label ➔
  [API /route] ➔ Routing Decision (e.g., escalate, normal queue)
Frontend displays all Outputs + Pipeline Progress
🖥️ Frontend Features
Upload Form: Add new ticket (raw text).

Ticket List Table: Shows all tickets, original message, summary, sentiment, route.

Pipeline Visualization: Shows which step each ticket is at.

Agent Attribution: For each ticket/column, display which agent endpoint generated the result.

Escalation Highlight: Tickets flagged for escalation are highlighted.

Error/Feedback Display: Show API status, latency, errors, and logs per agent.

🧑‍💻 Example Usage and API Calls
typescript
// 1. Summarization
POST /summarize
Body: { "text": "I can't log in and your password reset isn't working. Help!" }
→ Response: { "summary": "Customer unable to log in, password reset failed" }

// 2. Sentiment
POST /sentiment
Body: { "summary": "Customer unable to log in, password reset failed" }
→ Response: { "sentiment": "frustrated", "urgency": "high" }

// 3. Routing
POST /route
Body: { "summary": "...", "sentiment": "...", "urgency": "..." }
→ Response: { "action": "escalate_to_human" }
📊 Example Dataset
json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "text": "I tried to pay my bill online but your site kept giving error 500, and the chatbot was no help at all.",
    "expected_summary": "Customer unable to pay bill online, website error 500, chatbot unhelpful.",
    "expected_sentiment": "frustrated",
    "expected_urgency": "high"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "text": "Just wanted to let you know the delivery was late but it arrived safely. Thanks.",
    "expected_summary": "Delivery was late but item arrived safely.",
    "expected_sentiment": "neutral",
    "expected_urgency": "low"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "text": "Reset my password 3 times, still can't get access. Please fix this ASAP or I'll move to another provider!",
    "expected_summary": "Password reset failed multiple times, customer threatens to leave.",
    "expected_sentiment": "angry",
    "expected_urgency": "critical"
  }
]
🚦 Mapping: Endpoint Responsibility
Pipeline Step	Agent Endpoint	What it Does
Summarize Ticket	/summarize	Accepts raw ticket, returns concise summary
Analyze Sentiment/Urgency	/sentiment	Accepts summary, returns sentiment/urgency label
Route Ticket (Escalate?)	/route	Accepts summary+sentiment+urgency, returns action
🚀 How to Run
Use paragon create to make each agent (summarize, sentiment, route).

Use paragon deploy to launch them on your cluster.

Start the frontend dashboard and point to the deployed API endpoints.

Upload tickets, and watch as the pipeline triages and routes in real-time!
